Leaderboard
=========
The leaderboard is designed so that you can combine students into groups and then rank their groups based on the amount of good study habits they take part in. These include doing assignments and quizzes early, attempting quizzes multiple times, posting and responding on a forum, and participating in a choice (essentially a poll).

Installation
-----------
Install the block and add it to a course page

Set up
------
1. While student data will be recorded either way, to properly display team scores you will have to set up students in teams for their information to be displayed on the leaderboard. 
2. The leaderboard offers the option of 'resetting' scores twice part way through the semester. This does not involve deleting any data, merely setting all scores on the leaderboard back to 0 after, say, an exam, so students will have a chance to start fresh if they got off to a bad start. To properly use this functionality, it is necessary to do the following:
-- Set the start and end date of the course in 'coursename/Edit settings'
-- Set the Leaderboard Reset Settings in 'Site administration/Plugins/Blocks/Leaderboard' at the bottom of the page.
If you do not want these functionalities in place simply assign the resets to the start or end of the course.

Settings
------
If you wish to change any of the point values or day early times simply go to 'Site administration/Plugins/Blocks/Leaderboard' and plug in the values you desire. Then make sure to save your changes.

Q/A

Q0: What if a team is smaller than other teams? Will they be at a disadvantage?
A0: If a team happens to be smaller than the average team size, don't worry, they will get extra points based on their team's average points per person. These will be displayed as "Extra Points" in the table. 

Q1: What are ways that students can earn points?
A1: A team can earn points by practicing good study habits. Turning in assignments and completing quizzes early will award the most points. Other ways of earning points include spacing out quizzes instead of cramming them into one, retaking quizzes for extra practice, posting and responding to questions on the forum, and even rating a team's understanding in the choice module will all award points.

- Submit Assignments 5 days early to earn 5 points,

Q3: I submitted an assignment early, why don't I see any points?
A3: This is normal. Your points will not be recorded in the leaderboard until after the due date for an assignment or quiz has passed. This is in place to so that an assignment cannot earn points for submission both before and after a reset. 
Q4: Is student's data being logged?
A4: Yes. This data is being used for the purpose of allowing a teacher to track in class study habits and how to improve them. However names and personal data are not attached to any of the data being logged.
